This was a 2 man project for a UIC class. There are two Arduino parts, the robot and the remote.
The remote went with my partner and the robot stayed with me as I paid for most of the parts.
The remote connects via bluetooth. This allows for a smart phone app to take its place if required.

The power supply is a 10000MaH power bank, allowing for a 5v power to the motors and 5v to the arduino/bluetooth module.
I wrote the programming for this robot, and the omni wheels allow for it to move in any direction at any moment, plus able to rotate.

I have plans to add mmore power to the wheels and a more stable base. The base is currently small wood peices designed for small art peices wood-glued together.

The files here include the program loaded to the arduino via Arduino IDE, a video of the robot in a programmed in demo mode and a still picture.
